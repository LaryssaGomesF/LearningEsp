# ESP32 Learning Project

This project is a practical learning repository for the ESP32, where I explore and implement different functionalities such as GPIO, Timer, ADC, among others. Each time I learn and implement something new, I add the code and a GIF from the simulator showing the result.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to document my progress in learning the ESP32, sharing practical and functional examples of each learned functionality.

## Learned Functionalities

### Traffic Light using GPIO

The first implementation was a simple traffic light using the GPIO pins of the ESP32. This demonstration shows how to control LEDs to simulate a basic traffic light.


### Traffic Light using Timer

The second implementation was a more sophisticated traffic light using the ESP32 Timer to control the timing of the light changes. This version is more efficient and precise in time control.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate access to different examples and learned functionalities:


├── gpio/ main/ main.c
